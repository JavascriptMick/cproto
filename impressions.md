- Everything is super clean, intuitive and minimal, this language is awesome!
- Where is my declare and assign in one statement?
- define is super powerful and feels very close to the compiler.  Are these the same as macros?
```
#define TOOMUCHPOWER printf("Hello World")
```
- getchar() is wierd, the chars only get got when iffen you press the enter button but they echo all the time?!.  Googol that and get the first sniff of behaviour differences in different os's (i'm on a mac).. here we go.

#1.6  Arrays
- Still clean and nice
